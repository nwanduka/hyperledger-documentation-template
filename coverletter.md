The Program Managers,

Hyperledger Mentorship Programme,

Hyperledger Foundation.


Dear sir,

## An Application to be a Mentee for the Hyperledger Caliper Documentation Platform Update Project.

I am writing to express my interest in the Hyperledger Caliper Documentation Platform Update project.
- ### How did you find out about our mentorship program?
  
  I first learned about the LFX Mentorship program last year from a school mate who had been selected as a mentee for one of the projects. She shared the news of her acceptance on LinkedIn and it got me digging for more information about the program.
When the next mentorship round was announced, I applied for one of Hyperledger’s projects (Hyperledger - Explorer User Interface redesign). Unfortunately, I was not selected but I remained in the community, followed the mentors on LinkedIn so that I would keep abreast with what was going on in the community and be informed when the next application round opens up.
- ### Why are you interested in this program?
  
  For this round, I’m interested in the “Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform update” project. I’m particularly interested in this project because it allows me to leverage my skills in user experience design and writing to improve the user experience and accessibility of the Caliper documentation. As a new contributor myself, I understand the challenges faced by others new to the project and I believe this lets me bring fresh perspectives that would otherwise have been overlooked. I'm interested in using my UX design and writing skills to lower the barrier to entry for new users and developers, drive more contributor engagement with the project, and potentially increase the adoption of Hyperledger Caliper.
- ### What experience and knowledge/skills do you have that are applicable to this program?
  
  During my internship at Layer5, I improved the project's documentation, so this isn’t my first rodeo. My work involved documenting new features, updating existing content, and ensuring the documentation appealed to both technical and non-technical users. The Layer5 documentation page is written in Markdown so I have a good grasp of Markdown. Here are some of the documentation pages that I worked on:
  - Meshery relationships: https://docs.layer5.io/meshmap/concepts/relationships/
  - MeshMap comment feature: https://docs.layer5.io/meshmap/designer/comments/
  - Cloud user notification preferences: https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/identity/users/notification-preferences/
  - Visualizer views: https://docs.layer5.io/meshmap/visualizer/visualizer-views/
    
  One of the core skills I’ve developed as a User Experience Designer is empathy. In order to design products that are not just functional but are useful to the user, I’ve learned to put myself in the users’ shoes, feel their frustrations, so that I know exactly how to solve their pain points. Documentation works in much the same way. In this case, my users are the project's contributors and general users. My empathetic nature as a designer will help me create clear and concise documentation that caters to a diverse audience.

  I also have over three years of writing experience. Writing has taught me the fundamentals of research and communication which are skills that I believe are necessary to excel in this documentation project. I understand that in order for me to clearly document the Caliper project, I need to know about the project and how it works. While I may be new to the specifics of Hyperledger Caliper, I'm a fast learner and eager to acquire the necessary knowledge to excel in this program. 
- ### What do you hope to get out of this mentorship experience?
  I hope to gain a deeper understanding of blockchain technology, particularly Hyperledger Caliper. This mentorship would be an invaluable opportunity to develop my technical writing skills and contribute to creating clear and user-friendly documentation for this important project. I'm also eager to gain more experience working in an open-source environment and connect with experienced mentors and peers who can guide my growth. I'd love to find ways to integrate my UX design skills into the documentation process to further enhance user experience.

I am highly motivated and committed to learning and contributing to the success of the Hyperledger Caliper project. Thank you for considering my application.


Sincerely,

Victoria Nduka

Soon-to-be Hyperledger Mentee (hopefully)
